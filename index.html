      In Vimond I was lead designer for Vimond IO, a browser based 4K video editor. For CNBC our team designed and implemented an archival and retrieval system for live broadcast, indexing closed captioning for efficient search. In TV 2 Sumo I did a redesign of their app for Android, with offline support and other new features.</p>
